I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Jayhawk Data Science Lab, University of Kansas, advised by [Dr. Zijun Yao](https://ittc.ku.edu/~zyao/). My research interests include Data Mining, Health Informatics, Natural Language Processing, Graph Learning, and Interpretability.

Previously, I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from Guangdong University of Technology (2024), advised by [Dr. Fenghuan Li](https://dblp.org/pid/07/10130.html), where I worked on interpretable depression detection on social media using heterogeneous and subgraph GNNs with contrastive learning.

[Here is my CV.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Tjkj__hEPyMDef0W3BPiehrk6DqvqxN/view?usp=sharing)
